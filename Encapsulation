What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object, so users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object. Encapsulation can be used to hide both data members and data functions or methods associated with an instantiated class or object.

Benefits of encapsulation orogramming
Encapsulation in programming has a few key benefits. These include:
1.Hiding data: Users will have no idea how classes are being implemented or stored. All that users will know is that values are being passed and initialized.
2.More flexibility: Enables you to set variables as red or write-only. Examples include: setName(), setAge() or to set variables as write-only then you only need to omit the get methods like getName(), getAge() etc.
3.Easy to reuse: With encapsulation, it's easy to change and adapt to new requirements
